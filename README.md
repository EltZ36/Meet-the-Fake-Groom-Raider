This is the final game from CMPM 121 where you have to create a fake game from a show. 
My show was 12oz. Mouse which had a fake game called Groom Raider and I was supposed to flesh out the game. This ended with me making this game that was very simple and I decided to make it endless and to include two extra characters.
